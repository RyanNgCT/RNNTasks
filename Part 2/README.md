# Character Generation with Sherlock Holmes üîç
Generate a semi-coherent English sentence using RNN architectures. Use of differing architectures (LSTM, GRU), layer structure (nodes and number of layers) and Window Size (100, 200, 300).

## Shortlist Evaluation
* Have a high final epoch training accuracy
* When I visual assess the words generated at last epoch for
  * Temperature = 0.5 and
  * Temperature = 1.0,
The model should have a high percentage of english words since the objective is to predict a semi-coherent sentence.

## Evaluation Criteria
*	Appropriate punctuations placements
*	Distributions of words and frequency of English words (check for repetition)
*	Be able to generate a label that can possibly be used construct and English word given a new input


Best Model: **Model 16** (see [report](https://github.com/RyanNgCT/RNNTasks/blob/master/DL_Assignment2_Report_NG%20CHIN%20TIONG%20RYAN.pdf) for scoring)
